# Rogue-Like-Game
A comprehensive C++ roguelike dungeon crawler where players navigate procedurally generated, fully connected dungeons containing rooms, corridors, rock with variable hardness, and functional stairs. The game supports cross-compatible file-based dungeon save/load, ensuring any dungeon can be read by any correct implementation. NPC monsters, both tunneling and non-tunneling, use Dijkstra-based pathfinding and have varied AI behaviors, creating dynamic and unpredictable encounters. The player character (PC) is controlled through a curses-based interface, featuring fog of war and a remembered terrain map for immersive exploration. Combat incorporates hit points, damage dice, and unique monster abilities, while a robust parser loads custom monster and object descriptions from text files, replacing random generation with defined entities. Objects are placed throughout the dungeon and can be picked up, equipped, and used, enhancing the PCâ€™s combat capabilities. With responsive turn-based gameplay, persistent world state, and a fully modular codebase, the game showcases procedural generation, AI pathfinding, object-oriented design, and interactive terminal-based gameplay.
